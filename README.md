Test1-KeDA Tech Test

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) a ReactJS Framework project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Dev

## Learn More about NextJS

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/)

```bash
-Why do I use NextJS?
Because NextJS is the framework of React framework. It does all the ReactJS job but with easier routing management. As it automates many of the build processes and offers built in support for server-side rendering. Why server side rendering? Because, we as front end engineer and developer know how hard it is to sync the client side and server side render, NextJS solve it by running it on a serverless environment.
TLDR it simplifies ReactJS development for a static site or an application that does not require complex routing.

## Learn More about TailwindCSS

- [TailwindCSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) - learn about TailwindCSS features.

You can check out [the TailwindCSS GitHub repository](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss)

```bash
-Why do I use TailwindCSS?
Because it took css to the next level as SASS does but with its own syntax. More like a bootstrap reboot but still retain its simplicity and add more custom variable like SASS does. I did use SASS and bootstrap the first time I step into front end world, but after time I discover a more easier to use styling tools called styled-component. I liked it, but then TailwindCSS kept me company until now because it combines the simplicity of bootstrap and add more customizability to the library like styled-components.
TLDR I can just add custom variable to TailwindCSS config file and just use it like bootstrap.
